    <h3>Description:</h3>

        <p>This smoked Gouda mac and cheese is marvelously smooth with a bit of a bite. My family loves it. I got the idea from a recipe made on a popular cooking show and adapted it to my own tastes. Serve with a sweeter main dish for a delicious contrast.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (12 ounce) package shell pasta</li>
            <li>2 ½ tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>2 ½ cups milk</li>
            <li> ½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li> ¼ teaspoon ground white pepper</li>
            <li>4 ounces smoked Gouda cheese, shredded</li>
        </ul>
        
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a casserole dish.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add shell pasta and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 9 minutes.</li>
            <li>While the pasta is cooking, melt butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk in flour and stir until mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown, 2 to 4 minutes. Gradually whisk in milk, salt, and pepper, then bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook, whisking constantly, until sauce is smooth and thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Drain pasta and transfer to a large bowl. Pour cheese sauce over top and mix until thoroughly combined. Transfer to the prepared casserole dish.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until heated through, about 15 minutes.</li>
        </ol>

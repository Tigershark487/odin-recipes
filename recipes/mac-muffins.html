        <ol>

            <li>Stir together bread crumbs, olive oil, and salt in a small bowl until well combined; set aside.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook pasta in boiling water until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and return pasta to the pot.</li>
            <li> Stir beaten egg and butter into cooked pasta until pasta is evenly coated. Stir in mozzarella cheese, 1 cup Cheddar cheese, and milk until well combined. Spoon mixture into the prepared muffin tin. Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese. Sprinkle bread crumb mixture over the tops.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the topping is nicely browned, about 30 minutes. Allow mac and cheese cups to set for a few minutes before removing from the pan.</li>
